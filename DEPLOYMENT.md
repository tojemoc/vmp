# Deployment and Environment Strategy

## Unified environment variables

Use the root `.env.example` as the single source template for all runtime values.

Copy per environment:

- `.env.staging`
- `.env.production`

For local API development, mirror required values into `packages/api/.dev.vars` (never commit secrets).

## Multi-domain setup

Keep domain-specific values as env overrides:

- `FRONTEND_URL`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `R2_BASE_URL`

Deploy each domain with its own Wrangler environment and secret set.

## CI/CD flow

Canonical deploy workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

`deploy.yml` is the only supported deployment workflow.

The canonical workflow uses:

- pushes to `main` -> staging deploy
- version tags (`v*.*.*`) -> production deploy

Required repository secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_STAGING`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_PROD`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID_STAGING`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID_PROD`
- `STAGING_SMOKE_AUTH_TOKEN` (shared secret for staging `/api/admin/smoke-auth` smoke check)
- `PROD_SMOKE_AUTH_TOKEN` (shared secret for production `/api/admin/smoke-auth` smoke check)

Note: the deploy workflow reads these exact `CLOUDFLARE_*_STAGING/PROD` secret names.

Required environment variables (GitHub Environments/Repository Variables):

- Staging:
  - `API_URL_STAGING`
  - `FRONTEND_URL_STAGING`
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STAGING`
  - `CF_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME_STAGING`
- Production:
  - `API_URL_PROD`
  - `FRONTEND_URL_PROD`
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS_PROD`
  - `CF_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME_PROD`

The hardened workflows now enforce:

- API and web builds use the environment-specific `API_URL_*`.
- Deploy steps use environment-specific Cloudflare token/account secrets.
- Post-deploy smoke checks validate:
  - `/api/health` payload (`{ status: "healthy" }`)
  - CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` against `FRONTEND_URL_*`
  - machine smoke-auth endpoint (`GET /api/admin/smoke-auth`) via `X-Smoke-Token`
  - frontend reachability.

Smoke auth endpoint details:

- Route: `GET /api/admin/smoke-auth`
- Header: `X-Smoke-Token: <token>`
- Secrets used by workflow:
  - Worker env secrets: `SMOKE_AUTH_TOKEN_STAGING` / `SMOKE_AUTH_TOKEN_PROD`
  - GitHub Action secrets: `STAGING_SMOKE_AUTH_TOKEN` / `PROD_SMOKE_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Token must match exactly (timing-safe compare); use a long random value and rotate as needed.

## Fresh infrastructure bootstrap runbook

Use this when staging/production D1, KV, and/or R2 were intentionally reset.

1) Freeze auto-deploys

- Confirm `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is the only active deployment workflow.

1. Recreate bindings/resources (per environment)

- D1 database
- KV namespace(s)
- R2 bucket(s)
- Update Worker/Page bindings to point to recreated resources.

1. Restore required secrets (per environment)

- `JWT_SECRET`
- `BREVO_API_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `RSS_SECRET`
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CF_API_TOKEN`

1. Re-apply database migrations in order

- Run all SQL files in `packages/api/migrations/` in ascending order.
- Do not edit historical migration files; add new numbered migrations as needed.

### Migration safety closure + regression gates

Run these commands after migrations and before promoting traffic:

1) Idempotent backfill/mapping script

- Local dry-run style check:
  - `npm run db:migration-backfill --workspace=@vmp/api`
- Remote target:
  - `DB_NAME=video-subscription-db npm run db:migration-backfill --workspace=@vmp/api -- --remote`
- Expected success signal:
  - Output includes `[backfill] Completed successfully.`
  - Re-running should produce the same success output with no errors.
- Failure interpretation:
  - Any non-zero exit means schema drift (missing columns/tables) or DB connectivity issues.
  - Resolve schema mismatch first, then rerun migrations and this backfill.

2) Integrity verification script (hard PASS/FAIL gate)

- Local:
  - `npm run db:migration-verify --workspace=@vmp/api`
- Remote:
  - `DB_NAME=video-subscription-db npm run db:migration-verify --workspace=@vmp/api -- --remote`
- Expected PASS output:
  - Row counts emitted for key tables.
  - Final line: `[verify] PASS: all integrity checks are zero.`
- Expected FAIL output:
  - Integrity failures: Final line `[verify] FAIL: <n> integrity check(s) are non-zero.` — command exits `1`; deployment should stop until non-zero checks are fixed.
  - Schema failures: Final line `[verify] FAIL: <n> required schema check(s) missing.` — command exits `1`; deployment should stop until schema drift is resolved.
  - Operators should look for either failure message when triaging verification issues.

3) Targeted deterministic regression suite (Task 12)

- `npm test --workspace=@vmp/api -- --test-name-pattern="clampNewsletterPollIntervalMs|isNewsletterSendFinished|fetchBrevoEmailCampaignsWithRetry|evaluateRoleChange|evaluateSelfRoleChange|evaluateSubscriptionStatusChange|segment analytics|normalizeLivestreamStatus|normalizeStripeStatus|normalizeGoCardlessStatus|placeHomepageVideos matrix|sortCategoriesForHomepage|placementTimestampMs"`
- Expected PASS signal:
  - Node test runner summary reports all listed suites passing, zero failed tests.
- Failure interpretation:
  - Any failing suite blocks deployment; fix regression and rerun full targeted command.

1. Seed data policy

- Staging: seed freely for smoke testing.
- Production: seed only intentional baseline config; avoid test/demo data.

1. Deploy order

- Deploy API first.
- Deploy web second.

1. Post-deploy smoke checks

- `GET /api/health` returns healthy.
- Auth flow (magic link + session restore) works.
- Admin loads and can perform one write action.
- Homepage and watch routes render without server errors.
- If media was reset, validate expected behavior for missing/placeholder media.

## Rollback notes (staging/production)

Use the smallest rollback that restores service:

1. Full rollback
- Re-run `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` from a known-good commit/tag (`workflow_dispatch`) targeting the affected environment.
- Validate health, CORS, admin auth smoke checks, and homepage/watch rendering.

2. Emergency containment
- If staging deploy is unstable, pause merges to `main` until smoke checks are green.
- If production deploy is unstable, disable further production tags and roll back first, then investigate.

## Livestream provider notes (Cloudflare Stream Live)

- Livestream entries are stored as standard `videos` rows plus `livestreams` metadata rows.
- On livestream creation (`POST /api/admin/videos/livestreams`), the API provisions Cloudflare Stream Live ingest via `POST /stream/live_inputs` and stores:
  - `stream_id` (Cloudflare `uid`)
  - `ingest_url` (RTMPS ingest URL)
  - `stream_key`
  - `playback_url` (HLS URL, from API response or `CF_STREAM_CUSTOMER_CODE` fallback)
- If provisioning fails, the row remains in D1 with status `failed`. Admins can retry manually via `POST /api/admin/videos/:videoId/livestream/provision`.
- Cloudflare HLS playback URLs are consumed directly on the watch page for premium/staff viewers while live/ready.
- Direct provider playback currently does not support the same proxy tokenization and preview truncation controls used for VOD HLS in `/api/video-proxy`.
- Rewind/time-shift capability depends on provider playlist configuration; this integration assumes live-edge playback first, with explicit VOD handoff through admin swap once recording is available.
- To preserve durable playback and existing proxy protections, finalize streams by swapping in an uploaded VOD (`/api/admin/videos/:id/swap`) once recording is available.
