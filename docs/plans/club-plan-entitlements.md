# Club plan entitlements

**Roadmap:** [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) → *Club plan entitlements*  
**Status:** Not started (product spec; partial billing support exists)

## Product definition (360tka.sk / Stargaze heritage)

**Club** is **yearly billing with a higher price**, not a separate billing interval. On payment providers, club may share the same recurrence cadence as yearly (e.g. GoPay 12-month `MONTH` cycle) while `plan_type` stays `club` in D1 for entitlements and pricing.

Original marketing copy (paraphrased):

1. **IRL events** — invitations and free access to selected in-person events.
2. **Ad-free** — ad-free viewing if ads are ever added to the platform.

**Stargaze (legacy platform):** one **active device** could play **one video** at a time (hard limit). Club was intended to raise that to **two or three** concurrent streams per household/account.

### Not club entitlements

- **`offline_device_limit_club`** (`0037_offline_downloads.sql`) — caps how many devices can register for **offline download** licenses (default 5 vs club 10). This is abuse control for the PWA offline feature, **not** concurrent streaming. Do not conflate with Stargaze playback limits.

## Current VMP state

| Entitlement | Implemented? | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Distinct `plan_type = 'club'` | Yes | Subscriptions, checkout, admin pricing |
| Yearly-length period | Yes | `periodEndIsoForPlan` treats club like yearly (12 months) |
| Qerko legacy `subscriptionType: club` | Yes | Fixed: must not collapse to `yearly` on E-shop orders |
| GoPay / Comgate club checkout | Partial | Provider draft; club uses yearly recurrence where required |
| Concurrent playback limit | **No** | No server-side session tracking for streams |
| IRL event access | **No** | No invites, lists, or redemption flow |
| Ad-free playback | **No** | No ads in product today; no `plan_type` gate for ads |

## 1. Concurrent playback limits (priority)

### Goals

- Enforce **max concurrent active playback sessions** per subscriber account.
- Defaults (configurable via `admin_settings`):
  - `monthly` / `yearly`: **1** active stream (Stargaze parity for standard plans).
  - `club`: **3** (product default; tune via `concurrent_playback_limit_club`).
- Staff roles (`editor`+): exempt or high cap (match offline-downloads staff bypass pattern in `offlineDownloads.ts`).

### Non-goals (v1)

- Per-device naming UI for stream slots.
- Geo-fencing or household detection beyond account JWT.
- Limiting **preview** / anonymous traffic (keep existing anon rate limits only).

### Suggested architecture

```text
Client (player)                    API Worker
     |                                  |
     |-- POST heartbeat / session ----->|  upsert playback_sessions
     |    (videoId, sessionId)          |  (user_id, session_id, video_id,
     |                                  |   last_seen_at, user_agent hash?)
     |-- GET video-access / proxy ----->|  count active sessions for user
     |                                  |  if count >= limit && !this session:
     |<-- 409 concurrent_limit ---------|      reject new stream OR steal oldest
```

**Session identity:** client-generated `sessionId` (UUID) stored in `sessionStorage`; sent on `video-access` and segment/manifest requests (header e.g. `X-VMP-Playback-Session` or signed query param on proxy URLs).

**Active definition:** row in `playback_sessions` with `last_seen_at` within **90s** (configurable `concurrent_playback_stale_seconds`). Player sends heartbeat every **30s** while playing (pause/stop → DELETE or let stale expire).

**Enforcement points (pick one primary, one backup):**

1. **`GET /api/video-access/:videoId`** (preferred) — reject before issuing playlist URL when at cap and session not already registered.
2. **`/api/video-proxy/...`** — reject manifest/segment if session invalid (prevents URL sharing bypass). Must align with signed segment URLs (#4).

**Storage options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| D1 table `playback_sessions` | Simple, auditable, works on Workers | Needs periodic cleanup cron |
| Durable Object per user | Strong consistency, fast counting | New binding, migration path |

Recommendation: **D1** for v1 (consistent with `playback_positions`); revisit DO if race conditions appear under load.

### Schema sketch (D1)

```sql
CREATE TABLE playback_sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- client session UUID
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  video_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  started_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  last_seen_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE INDEX idx_playback_sessions_user_active ON playback_sessions(user_id, last_seen_at);
```

### API sketch

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `PUT` | `/api/account/playback-sessions/:sessionId` | Bearer | Heartbeat / register (`videoId`, optional `ended: true` to release) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/account/playback-sessions/:sessionId` | Bearer | Explicit end |

`video-access` and proxy: require valid session id for premium streams; return `409` + `{ code: 'concurrent_playback_limit', limit: N }` when exceeded.

### Web (`@vmp/web`)

- `useVideoPlayer` / watch page: create `sessionId` on play, heartbeat while `playing`, release on `pause`/`ended`/`beforeunload`.
- User-facing copy when blocked: explain club allows more devices; suggest stopping another session or upgrading.

### Admin settings

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `concurrent_playback_limit_default` | `1` | monthly + yearly |
| `concurrent_playback_limit_club` | `3` | club plan |
| `concurrent_playback_stale_seconds` | `90` | session TTL without heartbeat |

### Tests

- Unit: limit resolution by `plan_type`; stale session exclusion from count.
- Integration: N sessions allowed for club, N+1 rejected; monthly capped at 1.
- Player: heartbeat sent while playing; session cleared on navigate away.

### Rollout

1. Ship schema + API behind `admin_settings.concurrent_playback_enforced` (`0` default).
2. Enable in staging; monitor 409 rate.
3. Enable production; document in account FAQ.

## 2. IRL event access (future)

- Admin: create events, capacity, club-only flag.
- Account: list upcoming events, RSVP, check-in token (QR).
- Optional Brevo email for invitations.

*Defer detailed API until events product is scoped.*

---

## 3. Ad-free playback (future)

- Introduce `features.ads_enabled` (global) and `user.hasAdFree(plan)` → `plan_type === 'club'` OR staff.
- Player / layout: skip ad insertion when ad-free.
- No work until an ad insertion path exists.
